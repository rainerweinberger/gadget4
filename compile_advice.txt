# compiling the code on a new system can sometimes be challenging. Here a few commonly occuring errors:

Problem:
========

The output starts with

Build configuration:
SYSTYPE: 
CONFIG: examples/DM-L50-N128/Config.sh
EXEC: Gadget4

Solution:
=========

The SYSTYPE variable is not set. 
Check the file Makefile.systype, and comment out the system type you are interested in.



Problem:
========

fatal error: ’hdf5.h’ file not found

or similar *.h files

Solution:
=========

The include path which should lead to the header file of the respective libraries is incorrect.
Check the respective path in ./buildsystem/Makefile.path.* (* depends on your SYSTYPE) and make sure 
the "*_INCL" variable, in this case HDF5_INCL has a path that leads to the appropriate header file following -I.



Problem:
========

error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

SOLUTION:
=========

Scroll up to see which library.
Check the respective path in ./buildsystem/Makefile.path.* (* depends on your SYSTYPE) and make sure 
the "*_LIBS" variable, has a path that leads to the appropriate *.o or *.so files following -L.
